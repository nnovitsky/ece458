# README

## Quick start
Per [this medium article](https://medium.com/@sostomc011/https-medium-com-sostomc011-getting-started-with-django-mysql-and-react-js-backend-b962a7691486), ensure that you have newest version of python3 (should be 3.9.1) as well as pip installed (don't think the version is as important). For mac people (sorry Natalie): 
`python3 --version`
`pip3 --version`

Can start the virtual environment with 
`source virtualEnv/bin/activate`
And then `deactivate` to turn it off
